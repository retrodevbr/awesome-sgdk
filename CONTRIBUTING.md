# Contribution Guidelines

Please note that this project is released with a [Contributor Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). By participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms.

## Adding to this list

Please ensure your pull request adheres to the following guidelines:

- Search previous suggestions before making a new one, as yours may be a duplicate.
- Make sure the item is useful before submitting. That implies it has been used by you or others.
- Make an individual pull request for each suggestion.
- Use the following format: `[name](link) - Description.`
- Additions should be added to the bottom of the relevant category.
- Link to the GitHub repo or website, not a package manager.
- Keep descriptions short and simple, but descriptive.
- Start the description with a capital and end with a full stop/period.
- Check your spelling and grammar.
- Make sure your text editor is set to remove trailing whitespace.
- The pull request should have a useful title and include a link to the package and why it should be included.
- New categories or improvements to the existing categorization are welcome, but should be done in a separate pull request.

## Updating your PR

A lot of times, making a PR adhere to the standards above can be difficult. If the maintainers notice anything that we'd like changed, we'll ask you to edit your PR before we merge it. There's no need to open a new PR, just edit the existing one. If you're not sure how to do that, [here is a guide](https://github.com/RichardLitt/knowledge/blob/master/github/amending-a-commit-guide.md) on the different ways you can update your PR so that we can merge it.

## Quality Standards

To be on the list, projects should follow these quality standards:

- Generally useful to the SGDK/Genesis development community
- Actively maintained (unless it's a historical reference or archived for a good reason)
- **Must have commits within the last 2 years** - Projects with no commits for more than 2 years are considered abandoned and will not be included
- Documented
- Tests if applicable

Thank you for your suggestions!
